# scalingo .NET Core Buildpack


This is a [scalingo buildpack](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/deployment/buildpacks/custom) for [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/). It was forked from [jincod/dotnetcore-buildpack](https://github.com/jincod/dotnetcore-buildpack) which is a heroku custom buildpack. 

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/edouard-mangel/dotnetcore-buildpack/workflows/main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edouard-mangel/dotnetcore-buildpack/actions)

The Buildpack supports C# and F# projects. It searchs through the repository's folders to locate a `Startup.*` or `Program.*` file. If found, the `.csproj` or `.fsproj` in the containing folder will be used in the `dotnet publish <project>` command.

If repository contains **multiple** Web Applications (multiple `Startup.*` or `Program.*`), `PROJECT_FILE` and `PROJECT_NAME` environment variables allow to choose project for publishing.

## Usage


### Previous releases

```
scalingo buildpacks:set https://github.com/edouard-mangel/dotnetcore-buildpack#version
```

## Entity Framework Core Migrations

You cannot run migrations with the `dotnet ef` commands using **.NET Local Tools** once the app is built. Alternatives include:

### Enabling Automatic Migrations

- Ensure there is a .NET local tool manifest file(dotnet-tools.json) which specifies the dotnet-ef tool:

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install dotnet-ef
```

- Ensure the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable is set to `Production`. ASP.NET Core scaffolding tools may create files that explicitly set it to `Development`. scalingo config will override this (`scalingo config:set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`).
- Configure your app to automatically run migrations at startup by adding the following to the `.csproj` file:

```xml
<Target Name="PrePublishTarget" AfterTargets="Publish">
  <Exec Command="dotnet ef database update" />
</Target>
```

- Configure your connection string string appropriately, for example, for PostgreSQL:

`sslmode=Prefer;Trust Server Certificate=true`

### Manually Running Migration Scripts on the Database

- Manually run SQL scripts generated by Entity Framework Core in your app's database. For example, use PG Admin to connect your scalingo Postgres service.
